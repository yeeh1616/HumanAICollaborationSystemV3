a quarter of pupils had no formal schooling or tutoring at all.", "s18": "Children from higher income households were also more likely to have had online classes provided by their schools, spent much more time on home learning, and had access to resources such as their own study space at home.", "s19": "Children whose parents were out of work were much less likely to have additional resources such as computers, apps and tutors."}, {"s20": "Educators are well aware of the need to make up for the learning losses from the first lockdown, although it is very difficult to do this at the level of intensity, speed, and coverage necessary.", "s21": "Plans for a national tutoring programme are in the process of being rolled out.", "s22": "To enforce school shutdowns again before this has even got started may make a bad situation worse.", "s23": "To the extent that learning loss cannot be made up, this will have long-term effects on students.", "s24": "For example, failing to get a good grade in GCSE English has been shown to have important consequences for students\u2019 trajectories with longer-term implications in the labour market.", "s25": "As the Delve Initiative (2020) puts it \u2018the skills loss from missing school is not trivial, and is likely to lead to lower earnings, higher risk of poverty and unemployment with impacts on health and life expectancy\u2019."}, {"s26": "Closing schools again is likely to have big adverse effects on children\u2019s learning.", "s27": "But this is not the end of the story: many parents struggled with the additional burden of full-time childcare and supervising home learning when schools closed in March.", "s28": "Evidence from surveys in lockdown indicate that working parents struggled to cope with these new demands, and that women were more likely to lose their jobs or be furloughed.", "s29": "When fathers reduced their work, they did a greater share of childcare than usual, although women still did the lion\u2019s share of the extra work.", "s30": "Moreover, during the spring lockdown, 45% of mothers\u2019 work hours and 26% of fathers\u2019 were simultaneously spent taking care of children.", "s31": "Consequently, there were large declines in mental health among those with young children."}, {"s32": "Overall, school closures have obvious adverse effects on children \u2013 which are large in magnitude \u2013 and also have a wider effect on family life which further hinders mental health, work, and general resilience.", "s33": "The costs of further closure should not be underestimated.", "s34": "Indeed, a recent commentary in Science states that \u2018If communities prioritize suppressing viral spread in other social gatherings, then children can go to school.\u2019 This is what the government is trying to achieve, and it should continue this path."}]
